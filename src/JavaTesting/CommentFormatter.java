/**
 * The loop function just accepts a body of a loop and returns an instance of
 * class LoopUnlessCond (which encapsulates this body object). Note that the
 * body didn't get evaluated yet. Class LoopUnlessCond has a method unless which
 * we can use as a infix operator. This way, we achieve a quite natural syntax
 * for our new loop: loop { < stats > } unless ( < cond > ).
