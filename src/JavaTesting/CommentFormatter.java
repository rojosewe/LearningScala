/**
 * Any method which takes a single parameter can be used as an infix operator in
 * Scala. Here is the definition of classMyBool which defines three methods and,
 * or, and negate.
 * 
 * As the first line of this code shows, it is also possible to use nullary
 * methods as postfix operators. The second line defines an xor function using
 * the and and or methods as well as the new not function. In this example the
 * use of infix operators helps to make the definition of xor more readable.
