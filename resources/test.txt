A Java compiler checks that a program contains handlers for checked exceptions by analyzing which checked exceptions can result from execution of a method or constructor. For each checked exception which is a possible result, the throws clause for the method or constructor must mention the class of that exception or one of the superclasses of the class of that exception.
Since Scala has no checked exceptions, Scala methods must be annotated with one or more throws annotations such that Java code can catch exceptions thrown by a Scala method.
